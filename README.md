# Shadcn with NextJS, Tailwind, Yarn on MacOS (2024)

I really love a good toast. And this repo did it for me.

## Got Node?

Be sure to have the right node version installed and use nvm to reduce your confusion. This was the correct one in 2024 of August for me.

```
nvm install 20.9.0
nvm use 20.9.0
```

## Make a NextJS app

You can either keep it simple (JS) or make it more complex (TS + linter).

```
yarn create next-app . --tailwind --typescript --eslint
```

## Throw in Shadcn

You get a wizard once you cast the shadcn spell.

```
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Go ahead and yarn

I'm so used to doing npm but I know yarn makes me cooler.

```
yarn dev
```

## Add a fancy shadcn component

I'm partial to terms of services checkboxes so …

```
npx shadcn@latest add checkbox
```

Then go to src/app/page.js and add in the sample code you found on the checkbox page over at shadcn/ui.

## Leverage the magic of Tailwind

You can mess with the classes and create a styled checkbox

```
...
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
        <Checkbox
          id="terms"
          className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-500 border-gray-300 rounded focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-2 dark:text-blue-500 dark:border-gray-600 dark:focus:ring-blue-500 hover:border-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-100"
        />
        <label
          htmlFor="terms"
          className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-300 cursor-pointer"
        >
          Accept terms and conditions
        </label>
      </div>
...
```

## What else can you do?

I saw demo of the Sonner component on YouTube the other day and definitely wanted it for myself. I can't resist a beautiful toast.

```
npx shadcn@latest add button
npx shadcn@latest add sonner
```

You'll need to change the components/ui/button.jsx at the very top.

```
"use client"
```

Modify your src/app/layout.js to add the Toaster reference.

```
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";

import { Toaster } from 'sonner';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <Toaster />
        {children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Let's stop pretending we're a Vercel advert and change page.js

```
'use client';

import { toast } from 'sonner';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <Button
        variant="outline"
        onClick={() => {
          console.log("Button clicked");
          toast("Event has been created", {
            description: "Sunday, December 03, 2023 at 9:00 AM",
            action: {
              label: "Undo",
              onClick: () => console.log("Undo clicked"),
            },
          });
        }}
      >
        Show Toast
      </Button>
    </main>
  );
}
```

And then you get something pretty wonderful.

## What to do next?

Now that I've figured this out, I definitely need to do some more stuff. I hope this works for you! -JM
